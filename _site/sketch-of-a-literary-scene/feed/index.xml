		<description><![CDATA[I’m impressed, I have to say. Really hardly ever do I encounter a blog that’s both educative and entertaining, and let me tell you, you could have hit the nail on the head. Your concept is excellent; the issue is something that not enough people are talking intelligently about. I&#039;m very happy that I stumbled across this in my seek for one thing referring to this.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Hi Max
Nice piece on Khartoum!
This city has deteriorated beyond what one would expect from corrupt  city
managment. Until the first devaluation of the Sudanese pound in 1978, Khartoum was a well-kept, clean and busy city. Your description brought back lots of memories of  the cultural scene of the seventies when we as dwellers of Omdurman, the Mahadi&#039;s stronghold-turned-into- a city, were able to cross the bridge on the Nile. We would first go for an ice cream or juice in the open-air cafe with it is famous central square-The Athenée, wrongly conveyed to you as Etienne. Then we would proceed along alJamhouriya street where bookshops and a place for selling used stamps would delay our progression to Khartoum University.
Your mention of Bringi and Kamal Eljizouli  nailed down all  the nostalgia!]]></description>
