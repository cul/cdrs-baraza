		<description><![CDATA[Thanks   nice review.  I admit I haven&#039;t read all of Mamdani&#039;s book, but this stmuamion caught my attention:   By labeling Khartoum as gc3a9nocidaires and the Darfuris as victims, there is very little room for reconciliation or peace talks, the normal processes for ending an uprising or civil war.   It seems to me, though, that civil wars can end in myriad ways, depending on the nature of the politics and tactics used.  There&#039;s an implicit assumption in Mamdani&#039;s argument (as presented here) that, sans the  wrong&#039; labeling, reconciliation or peace talks would have been effective.  Not necessarily true, given the nature of the violence.  One can think about Rwanda, given its highly studied processes of reconciliation.  But Rwanda is different from Sudan in that the RPF has undisputed military control over the country.  Besides, even if Rwanda is peaceful for now, it&#039;s not clear that Kagame will be able to keep a lid on things indefinitely.  Arguably, that civil war just spilled over into the DRC.Another point   does Mamdani even define genocide correctly in his book?  The UN definition is the elimination of a group  in whole or in part,  while he defines it (wrongly) as  killing with intent to eliminate an entire group.  Mamdani&#039;s discussion about the political semantics of genocide is certainly provocative, but I&#039;m not sure it&#039;s fair to use his book as a rigorous examination of these issues, and then to hold other writers to account.Regarding the open-ended questions posed at the end of the review, it&#039;s difficult to know for sure how various groups of people react to certain kinds of labeling.  (Are we talking about Americans?   Westerners ?  Jews and other groups that have been eliminated in whole or in part?)  In the U.S., we make a judicial distinction between first-degree murder and manslaughter.  Intent matters in the eyes of the law, and ethically, as well.  As it should.]]></description>
