		<description><![CDATA[Hello Michael,
I&#039;ve just seen your delightful piece of over a year ago on the Ottoman postcards illustrating the cultural mix that was (and to an extent, still is) Ottoman Constantinople. I&#039;d be glad to keep up with any publications you&#039;ve devoted to this since. My area is the Judezmo or Ladino language of the Sephardic Jews of the empire. I wonder if you have come across any cards, photos, etc. illustrating the use of Judezmo along with other languages of the empire. If so, I&#039;d really like to see them - and would of course credit you in any publications in which I make use of them.
Best wishes,
David Bunis
