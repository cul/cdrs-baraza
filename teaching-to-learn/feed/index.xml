		<description><![CDATA[I am looking for help with a single word. With your Sudanese translation experience (or connections) might you help? I heard it from local people near the Jebel Marra  in 1981. Its not an Arabic word I know so may be a Darfuri dialect? 

Its (as I remember it anyway) TIGL and refers to an animal.

Any light you can shine would be much appreciated.]]></description>
